# Contributing

Please take a look at [our project board](https://github.com/froi/github-project-migrator/projects/1) to see what's being worked on and what isn't.

## Issues and Discussions

You can contribute with more than just code. If you find an error, want to make a suggestion, or just want to ask a question you can open up an issue or a discussion.

### What should be an issue, a discussion, or a pull request

My suggestion is to default to opening a discussion if you don't know where to open a discussion or submit an issue.

As a good rule of thumb you can follow this:

- If you want to ask a question open a discussion
- If you have feedback open a discussion
- If you want to suggest a feature open a discussion
- If you run into an error open up an issue

Pull requests should only be submitted when you change code or documentation and want to contribute it back.

Before submitting any of these please take a look if there is an issue, discussion, or pull request with the same or similar topic / issue you want to submit. It's always better to join a conversation and contribute your thoughts to it ðŸ˜Š.
